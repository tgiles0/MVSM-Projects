# MVSM-Projects

MVSM stands for Multi-Variable Stable Models

MVSM is similar in some ways to Prolog as like this language, MVSM uses rules and then the program finds the possible solutions given
the specified rules.

In MVSM rules and conditions are created as constraints so that the program, using these constraints will generate the stable models
(which satisfy these constraints) that are effectively stable solutions to the problem with the given constraints.

The purpose of this project was to generate all stable models of possible ship placements using Answer Set Programming.
This was the final project done in Logic in Computer Science course done in teams of two.
